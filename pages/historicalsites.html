                <h2>Moalboal Historical Sites</h2>
                <p>"Simala" is one of the Historical in Moalboal</p>
                <p>Moalboal, a charming coastal town in Cebu, Philippines, is not only known for its stunning beaches and vibrant marine life but also 
                    for its historical and cultural landmarks. These sites reflect the rich heritage and deep-rooted traditions of the area, offering 
                    visitors a glimpse into its storied past.<br>
                    One of the notable historical landmarks in Moalboal is St. John Nepomucene Parish Church, established in 1852. This Spanish-era church 
                    stands as a testament to the enduring Catholic faith of the locals and features classic colonial architecture, with its thick coral stone
                    walls and intricate details. The church is a serene place for reflection and an essential stop for history enthusiasts.<br>
                    Another must-visit site is Fortaleza de San Pedro, a small fort built during the Spanish period to protect the town from pirate invasions.
                    While the structure is not as prominent as Cebu City’s Fort San Pedro, it remains a reminder of Moalboal’s role in maritime defense during 
                    colonial times. Additionally, the Old Town Market in Moalboal serves as a historical landmark where locals and visitors can explore traditional
                    trading practices that have been passed down through generations. This market is a blend of history and culture, where vibrant stories of the past come to life.<br>
                    Simala, located in the town of Sibonga, Cebu, is home to the famous Simala Shrine, a significant religious and historical landmark in the province. The Shrine of Our 
                    Lady of Lindogon is a majestic castle-like church that has become a pilgrimage site for Catholics seeking spiritual blessings. The church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, 
                    is known for its stunning architecture, with its intricate design resembling a European castle, making it a popular attraction for both locals and tourists.
