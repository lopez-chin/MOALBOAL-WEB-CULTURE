                <p>Religion plays a significant role in the daily life of the people in Moalboal, with the majority of the population being Roman Catholic.
                   The town's strong Catholic faith is evident in the presence of churches, religious festivals, and community activities centered around religious devotion.<br>
                   One of the key religious landmarks in Moalboal is the St. John Nepomucene Parish Church, which is not only a place of worship but also a historical site dating
                    back to the Spanish era. This church serves as a gathering point for the community, where locals attend Mass, participate in sacraments, and celebrate religious 
                    holidays. The church plays a central role in the spiritual life of Moalboal, providing a sense of community and faith for its residents. Throughout the year,

                    processions, masses, and festivities, strengthening the sense of community and religious devotion.<br>
                    Religious practices are deeply integrated into the daily lives of the people. Many households have home altars, and prayers are an essential part of family life.
